feat: Add dbt Cloud Terraform automation with GitHub App sync fix

This major update adds complete Terraform-based dbt Cloud provisioning with an automated solution for GitHub App repository propagation delays.

## What's New

### dbt Cloud Automation
- Complete Terraform infrastructure-as-code for dbt Cloud projects
- Automated provisioning of projects, environments, connections, and jobs
- New Streamlit UI page for visual Terraform workflow with live progress
- dbt Cloud Admin API integration for project management

### Critical Bug Fix: Repository Clone Failures
Fixed the "repository 'https://github.com/None.git/' not found" error that occurred when jobs ran immediately after provisioning.

**Root Cause**: GitHub Apps take 30-60 seconds to propagate new repository access. When dbt Cloud queries GitHub for metadata during this window, it receives nothing, causing the repository full_name to remain null.

**Solution**: 
- Wait 30 seconds after Terraform apply for GitHub App propagation
- Call dbt Cloud Admin API to force repository metadata refresh
- Verify metadata population before triggering jobs
- Jobs now succeed automatically without manual intervention

### New Capabilities
- Snowflake connection configuration with credential management
- Separate dev and prod environments with proper credentials
- Production job scheduling with custom cron expressions
- Comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- Full state management across multi-step provisioning flow

## Files Changed

### New Modules
- src/dbt_cloud/api_client.py - dbt Cloud API client
- src/terraform_integration/ - Terraform generation and execution
- src/ui/pages/dbt_cloud_provisioning.py - Provisioning UI
- src/ui/pages/final_success.py - Success page with links
- terraform/ - Complete Terraform configuration (8+ resources)

### Documentation

### Configuration
- Enhanced AppConfig with Snowflake and Terraform settings
- Updated .env.example with new required variables
- Added .gitignore rules for Terraform state files
- Updated requirements for new dependencies

## Breaking Changes
None - fully backward compatible

## Migration Required
1. Add Snowflake configuration to .env (see .env.example)
2. Add GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID to .env
3. Install Terraform CLI for provisioning features

## Testing
- Verified end-to-end provisioning workflow
- Tested repository metadata sync with 30s delay
- Confirmed job runs succeed after automated metadata refresh
- Validated all Terraform resources create successfully
