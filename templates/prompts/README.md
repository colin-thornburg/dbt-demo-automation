# Prompt Templates

- `demo_scenario_system.txt` – system prompt that defines the persona.
- `demo_scenario_user.txt` – user prompt with placeholders filled by the app.

## Custom Guidance

Add any additional `.txt` files to this directory to enforce team-specific coaching or demo flow guidelines. The application automatically includes each file's contents in the AI instructions (sorted alphabetically by filename).

Example:

- `demo_guidelines.txt`
- `naming_standards.txt`

Remove or rename the file when you no longer need the guidance.
