Generate a dbt Cloud demo scenario for the following prospect:

**Company:** {company_name}
**Industry:** {industry}

{discovery_notes_section}
{pain_points_section}
{semantic_layer_section}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
The demo scenario MUST be built around the specific use case and analytics initiatives described in the Discovery Notes above. If they mention predictive modeling, customer segmentation, campaign optimization, or other specific analytics - your demo should center on EXACTLY those capabilities. Do NOT create a generic demo about inventory or sales unless that's specifically what they described.

Your data sources, models, and metrics should directly support the analytics use case they described. Use their terminology, their metrics, and their business context.

Create a demo scenario that includes:

1. **Demo Overview**: A 2-3 sentence summary that directly references their specific use case from the discovery notes
2. **Business Context**: What specific business problem are they trying to solve (based on discovery notes)?
3. **Data Sources**: 3-5 realistic source tables that would ACTUALLY be used for their described analytics use case (with descriptions). For example:
   - If they do customer segmentation → include customer behavior, campaign response, demographic data
   - If they do predictive modeling → include historical performance, features for predictions
   - If they do marketing optimization → include campaign, channel, conversion data
   Each table **must** include an explicit primary key column and list any foreign key columns that reference other tables.
4. **dbt Models Architecture** (must directly enable their described analytics use case):
   - **Staging Models** (3-5 models): Clean and rename source data that feeds into their specific analytics. Clearly map column renames so downstream models reference existing fields.
   - **Intermediate Models** (2-4 models): Business logic transformations that build the features, aggregations, or derived data needed for their specific use case. Ensure every join uses columns that exist in upstream models (e.g. join `orders.customer_id` to `customers.customer_id`). Never join on generic `id` columns unless they are explicitly defined.
   - **Marts Models** (2-3 models): Final analytics-ready tables that directly support the analytics they described (e.g., customer segments, campaign performance, predictive features). Highlight the grain of each mart and reuse the same join keys introduced earlier.
   {incremental_section}
5. **Key Metrics**: 3-5 business metrics that align with their described analytics initiatives (not generic metrics)
6. **Demo Talking Points**: 5-7 key points to emphasize during the demo, with at least 3 directly referencing how dbt enables their specific use case
{semantic_layer_talking_points}

**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

```json
{{
  "demo_overview": "string",
  "business_context": "string",
  "data_sources": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "columns": ["col1", "col2", "col3"]
    }}
  ],
  "staging_models": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "source_table": "string"
    }}
  ],
  "intermediate_models": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "depends_on": ["model1", "model2"]
    }}
  ],
  "marts_models": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "depends_on": ["model1", "model2"],
      "is_incremental": false
    }}
  ],
  "key_metrics": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "calculation": "string"
    }}
  ],
  "talking_points": [
    "string"
  ]
}}
```

All references between models must use columns that were defined earlier in the scenario. Avoid introducing new column names in joins.

**FINAL REMINDER:** 
- Make the entire demo scenario authentic to what {company_name} is actually trying to do (as described in discovery notes)
- Use terminology, data sources, and metrics that match their specific {industry} use case
- If no discovery notes were provided, create a realistic scenario for {industry}
- But if discovery notes ARE provided, they are your PRIMARY source of truth for what this demo should be about
