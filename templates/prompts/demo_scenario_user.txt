Generate a dbt Cloud demo scenario for the following prospect:

**Company:** {company_name}
**Industry:** {industry}

{discovery_notes_section}
{pain_points_section}
{semantic_layer_section}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
The demo scenario MUST be built around the specific use case and analytics initiatives described in the Discovery Notes above. If they mention predictive modeling, customer segmentation, campaign optimization, or other specific analytics - your demo should center on EXACTLY those capabilities. Do NOT create a generic demo about inventory or sales unless that's specifically what they described.

Your data sources, models, and metrics should directly support the analytics use case they described. Use their terminology, their metrics, and their business context.

Create a demo scenario that includes:

1. **Demo Overview**: A 2-3 sentence summary that directly references their specific use case from the discovery notes
2. **Business Context**: What specific business problem are they trying to solve (based on discovery notes)?
3. **Data Sources**: 3-5 realistic source tables that would ACTUALLY be used for their described analytics use case (with descriptions).

   MANDATORY RULES FOR DATA SOURCES:
   - Every table MUST have `id` as its FIRST column (this is the primary key)
   - Order tables so that parent/reference tables come BEFORE tables that reference them
   - Foreign key columns MUST be named `{{entity_singular}}_id` where `{{entity_singular}}` is the singular form of the referenced table name WITHOUT the `raw_` prefix
   - Example: `raw_customers` comes before `raw_orders`, and `raw_orders` has a column `customer_id`
   - Example: `raw_products` comes before `raw_order_items`, and `raw_order_items` has columns `order_id` and `product_id`
   - Include a mix of dimension (lookup) tables and fact (event/transaction) tables
   - Each table should have 5-10 columns including `id` and any foreign keys

4. **dbt Models Architecture** (must directly enable their described analytics use case):
   - **Staging Models** (3-5 models): Clean and rename source data. Each staging model's `source_table` must EXACTLY match a data source `name`. Staging models should be named `stg_{{source_name_without_raw_prefix}}`.
   - **Intermediate Models** (2-4 models): Business logic transformations that join staging models. `depends_on` must list exact staging model names. Joins will use the foreign key columns defined in the source tables.
   - **Marts Models** (2-3 models): Final analytics-ready tables. `depends_on` must list exact intermediate or staging model names.
   {incremental_section}
5. **Key Metrics**: 3-5 business metrics that align with their described analytics initiatives (not generic metrics)
6. **Demo Talking Points**: 5-7 key points to emphasize during the demo, with at least 3 directly referencing how dbt enables their specific use case
{semantic_layer_talking_points}

**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

```json
{{{{
  "demo_overview": "string",
  "business_context": "string",
  "data_sources": [
    {{{{
      "name": "raw_customers",

      "columns": ["id", "first_name", "last_name", "email", "created_at"]
    }}}},
    {{{{

    }}}}

  "staging_models": [
    {{{{

      "description": "Cleaned customer data",
      "source_table": "raw_customers"
    }}}}

    }}}}

      "calculation": "SUM(total_amount)"
    }}}}
  ],
  "talking_points": [
    "string"
  ]
}}}}
```

CRITICAL RULES — your JSON MUST follow these:
- Every data source `columns` array MUST start with `id`
- Foreign key columns MUST use the exact pattern `{{entity_singular}}_id` matching another table's name (minus the `raw_` prefix, singularized)
- `source_table` in staging models MUST exactly match a `name` in `data_sources`
- `depends_on` in intermediate/mart models MUST exactly match model `name` values
- Order `data_sources` so parent tables come first (tables with no foreign keys before tables that reference them)
- Include `created_at` and/or `updated_at` columns in tables where it makes sense
- Use at least one `is_incremental: true` mart model that has `updated_at` in its dependency chain

**FINAL REMINDER:** 
- Make the entire demo scenario authentic to what {company_name} is actually trying to do (as described in discovery notes)
- Use terminology, data sources, and metrics that match their specific {industry} use case
- If no discovery notes were provided, create a realistic scenario for {industry}
- But if discovery notes ARE provided, they are your PRIMARY source of truth for what this demo should be about
